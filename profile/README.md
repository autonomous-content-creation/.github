# Autonomous Content Creation/Autonomous Virtual Influencer

### TODO:

- Ensure GPT bot can understand most language on TikTok/YouTube/Twitter/Twitch.
- Ensure GPT bot can respond semi-normally to most generic TikTok/YouTube/Twitter/Twitch comments/messages/etc.
- Add trend detectors for TikTok and YouTube (specific, and non-specific).
- Add the ability to estimate what a meme is, and what it isn't.
- Add a way to guesstimate what the meaning of a meme is (discard if not understandable).
- Add a reverse slang translator, to return slang words instead of only intaking them.
- Add a separate name classification which allows the lookup of celebrities (firstname and lastname). If two celebrities have the same name, choose the more famous one.
- Add a name trend classifier to understand relevant celebrities, and use sentiment analysis to remove ones trending for negative reasons.
- Add a separate classification for music with the ability to equate albums and song names to matching artists (if they are relevant/trending).
- Add a way to recreate basic memes, be it through text generated images, or through generating short videos with TTS.
- Improve TTS tone variation depending on mood (use sentiment analysis with slang data).
- Add human element to bot (not 2D, 3D will be the only option to excel beyond others).
- Add a high speed database to handle storage of slang/trend/celebrity/meme/music/etc data.

*(early proof of concept showing the bot identifying the phrase "sussy baka", and showing it understands how to use it in a conversation.)*
